## Introduction
This assignment focuses on feature detection and matching in images using three key techniques:

Harris Corner Detection for identifying key points.
SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) for describing key point features.
Feature Matching using Sum of Squared Differences (SSD) and ratio distance to find correspondences between images.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation
To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy matplotlib
NOTE:change the image directory in the code to the respective directory.
